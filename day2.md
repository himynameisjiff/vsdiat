Chip Physical Design: From Floorplan to Placement and Characterization
The physical design of an integrated circuit (IC) involves a series of critical steps to translate a logical netlist into a manufacturable layout. Key considerations throughout this process include efficient resource utilization, signal integrity, and performance optimization.

Power Planning: Ensuring Stable Operation

Maintaining a stable power supply across the chip is paramount for reliable operation. Voltage drops across resistive interconnects can lead to "undefined behavior" if the voltage falls into the region between defined logic high and low levels.

Decoupling Capacitors (Decaps): These are large capacitors strategically placed on the chip to provide localized charge reservoirs. They "decouple" the circuit from direct power supply fluctuations, providing instantaneous current to logic gates and maintaining stable voltage levels.

Power Mesh: To mitigate these issues, power and ground networks are often split and distributed as a power mesh – an array of interconnected power and ground lines. This ensures that components draw power from and dump current to the nearest supply/ground source, reducing global fluctuations.



PLACEMENT - From the SCL. There are optimizations/CTS/ Buffers placed to optimize for space/distance/power.


Timing:
Slew Rate is time it takes to transition (I always thought it was called rise and fall).

Lo: 20% to High: 80% (I've seen stuff like 10-90 or even 40-60).

Global placement is slightly different from Placement. Global placement is more on the optimization and stuff whih detailed placement makes sure it still is legal and fits all the rules.

You can then view it in magic for verification and then can download LEF/DEF files.
